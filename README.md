# Installing
Install .NET

If you're not working in Visual Studio, you have to manage the development certificate.

    `dotnet dev-certs https --trust`
    
Once .NET is installed and the repo is cloned, you can run the web app locally with the following command

    `cd asp_tigertix`
    
    `dotnet watch run`

Once the webapp is running, you can make changes to code and it will automatically update on your localhost
